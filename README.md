# Teretana-WPF
University finished project

- "Gym" theme application. Works in WPF and SQL with detailed documentation and UML diagrams (sequential, collaborative and use cases).

-Lots of images have the same name so it's best not to move them out of their folders!

-Some of the abbreviations:

SK - use case.
OS - base scenario (images used in the base use case scenario).
AS - alternative scenario (images used in an alternative scenario of use cases).
Numbers like 2_1, 2_2, 2_1_1 etc. serve to link the images to their alternative scenario (eg image AS 2_1 refers to alternative scenario 2.1. in its use case.
UG - contracts (functions used in the program itself and used for communication with the database).
-Gym.rar file is an application. Compressed original app folder in case it can't be launched from the "Gym" folder.

-TeretanaScript.sql file is the database script.

-TeretanaBackup.bak file is a database backup.

- In the "Diagrams" folder, there are all the diagrams used in the documentation in their respective folders, the name of which shows exactly where they were used.

- The "Tables" folder is used for images of tables in the database.

- In the folder "Forms and messages" there are images of application forms and all messages that appear in the basic and alternative scenarios.
